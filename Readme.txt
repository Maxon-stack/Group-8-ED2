In this repository, you'll find the "server" folder which contains the code for the server. 
If you want to use it make sure you clone the repo (or pull if you've already cloned it) and navigate to the server folder from your terminal using the "cd" command and run "npm install."
Before this, make sure you have Node.JS and npm installed.
This will install the server's dependencies on your local machine which are found in the package.json file. Without these the server will not work.
